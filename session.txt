All that happens behind the hood with sessions and redis
---------------------------------------------=---------

1
Redis is a key value pair database. it stores sessions this way:
sess:efsdhgrtdhbsgf -> {userId: 1} (key:value)

2. 
when a user login, express session stores a cookie which is the 
signed/encrypted version of the redis key
(2wfsgfxgsdbdfbxvcxv)

3. 
when the user makes a request, the encrypted value stored in our browser is sent to the server
2wfsgfxgsdbdfbxvcxv -> server

4.
the cookie is decrypted using the secrete key passed during the session configuration to get the redis key
2wfsgfxgsdbdfbxvcxv -> sess:efsdhgrtdhbsgf

5. 
the decrypted redis key is then used to make a request to the redis database
sess:efsdhgrtdhbsgf -> {userId: 1}

6. 
the retrieved value is then stored in the request
req.session = {userId: 1}
